# Overview of Project

## Presentation: 
**Selected Topic** Boardgame

**Reason for Selection**
-   - Can we recommend board games to the people based on  likes, demographics or history?

**Description of the source data**

**Questions we hope to answer with the data**
   - What genre do people tend to enjoy the most? 
   - Which year released the most top-rated board games?
   - Based on your Boardgame preference, what boardgame will you play next? 
   - Can we recommend board games to the userâ€™s from our data set? 
   - After applying machine learning to categorize these games, does that match up with the genre field? 
  - **FINAL QUESTION DRAFT:** How does unsupervised machine learning categorize games vs the pre-existing genre/label assigned? 
  - Based on ONE choice/input from the user, what recommendations from pre-existing and machine learning labels can be made? 


## Communication Protocols (GitHub)
- At least one branch for each team member & each team member has at least 4 commits for segement 1. 
- The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline.

## Machine Learning Model
Present a provisional machine learning model 
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data
-   - Decision Tree: determine the importance of each column

## Database
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

## Ideas
- Using some of the different mechanics (artists, player votes, user rating, designer, publisher, honors)
- Tables in pgAdmin, ERD linkage and schematic, to help with Database Mockup and to see coorelations and possible differences in clusters for Machine Learning

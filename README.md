# Overview of Project

## Presentation: 
-	Selected Topic: Boardgame
-	Reason for Selection
   - Can we recommend board games to the people's likes, demographics or history?
-	Description of the source data
-	Questions we hope to answer with the data
   - What genre do people tend to enjoy the most? 
   - Which year released the most top-rated board games?
   - Based on your Boardgame preference, what boardgame will you play next? 
   - Can we recommend board games to the user’s from our data set? 
   - After applying machine learning to categorize these games, does that match up with the genre field? How does unsupervised machine learning categorize games vs the pre-existing genre/label assigned? 
   - Based on ONE choice/input from the user, what recommendations from pre-existing and machine learning labels can be made? 


## Communication Protocols (GitHub)
- At least one branch for each team member & each team member has at least 4 commits for segement 1. 
- The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline.

## Machine Learning Model
Present a provisional machine learning model 
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data
-   - Decision Tree: determine the importance of each column

## Database
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

# Overview of Project

## Presentation: 
For our final project, we agreed to dive into the fascinating world of Boardgames! Many enjoy the pastime of playing board games, and the reason for selecting this topic is to discover different ways of classifying board games based on a variety of characteristics in hopes of being able to recommend games people would enjoy. Along with recommendations, we plan to create a visual story of the games with descriptions, rules, mechanics, requirements for play, time to play, number of players, etc. This visual landscape can be explored by those eager to find new games and others who want to see how their favorites may be categorized and compared to other games.

Some questions we are asking include, yet are not limited to the following:
-	What genre do people tend to enjoy the most?
-	Which year released the most top-rated board games?
-	Can we recommend board games to the users based on boardgame characteristics?
-	After applying machine learning to categorize these games, does that match up with the genre field already established?
-	How does unsupervised machine learning categorize games vs the pre-existing genre/label assigned?

For the data we chose to use for our project, we collected source data that came from boardgamegeek and kaggle. The databases of board games are vast with their descriptions, rules, requirements for play, time to play, number of players, etc. A more in-depth description can be found in our r&d folder under DataDescription. Along with our original sourced and cleaned databases in our resources folder.


## Communication Protocols (GitHub)
- At least one branch for each team member & each team member has at least 4 commits for segement 1. 
- The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline.

## Machine Learning Model
Present a provisional machine learning model 
- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label(s) for input data
-   - Decision Tree: determine the importance of each column

## Database
- Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
- Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

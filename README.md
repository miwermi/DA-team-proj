# Overview of Project

## Presentation: 
For our final project, we agreed to dive into the fascinating world of Boardgames! Many enjoy the pastime of playing board games, and the reason for selecting this topic is to discover different ways of classifying board games based on a variety of characteristics in hopes of being able to recommend games people would enjoy. Along with recommendations, we plan to create a visual story of the games with descriptions, rules, mechanics, requirements for play, time to play, number of players, etc. This visual landscape can be explored by those eager to find new games and others who want to see how their favorites may be categorized and compared to other games.

Some questions we are asking include, yet are not limited to the following:
-	What genre do people tend to enjoy the most?
-	Which year released the most top-rated board games?
-	Can we recommend board games to the users based on boardgame characteristics?
-	After applying machine learning to categorize these games, does that match up with the genre field already established?
-	How does unsupervised machine learning categorize games vs the pre-existing genre/label assigned?

For the data we chose to use for our project, we collected source data that came from [boardgamegeek]( https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API) and [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/extralime/20000-boardgames-dataset). The databases of board games are vast with their descriptions, rules, requirements for play, time to play, number of players, etc. A more in-depth description can be found in our [r&d]( https://github.com/miwermi/DA-team-proj/tree/main/r%26d) folder under DataDescription. You can find our original sourced and cleaned databases in our [resources folder](https://github.com/miwermi/DA-team-proj/tree/main/resources).

## Communication Protocols 
   ~During Zoom meetings >> I would like for each of us to be heard and be able to contribute without getting talked over. I would like for us to go around the room, one at a time and share our thoughts and ideas. While one person is talking, everyone else is muted. Then only when the person talking says "pass" and mutes themselves, the next person can talk. We would establish an order of who talks next so it is not dominated by one person and so everyone can talk equally. If a person has nothing to say when it is their turn, they can say "pass" and it goes to the next person. Limit talk time to 2 minutes. Order is Abe, Courtney, Masie, Michelle, then Rachel.

## Machine Learning Model
Our goal for this project is to use K-Means unsupervised machine learning. We plan to use PCA to reduce the number of features, while also using Linear Regression analysis in R to see if the simpler model works better than K-Means. You will find our provisional Machine Learning in the file, [Machine_Learning.ipynb]( https://github.com/miwermi/DA-team-proj/blob/main/Machine_Learning.ipynb).

â€¢	Outputs label(s) for input data >> what are these? Do we need to pick categories for the output labels?


## Database
   - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema.
      ~separate tables of pertinent information (what are the columns for each table?) from cleaned data
      ~join tables together to get information/analysis desired
      ~create a single .csv for the machine learning model
   - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
      ~connect the model to the database using a connection string for Postgres (see link: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING)

## Group Project
History of Board Games, Game Stats Exploration, & Game Recommendation based on User Input
### Assets:
  -	2 Game Data CSV files
  -	Graphics….  Images of gameboards/characters
  -	Mad Skillz
### Steps needed:
  -	Data analysis – Jupyter Notebook?
    - Cleaning data – picking columns, creating new dataframe with only what we need/want
    - Transforming data – performing machine learning to find new types of clustes, creating second data frame to join with first
  - Figuring out what question(s) to ask users 
    - OPTIONS:
    
      SIMPLE: If these are simple questions:
        -	How old are you? Number only with error
        -	What type of games do you like?  Dropdown
        -	Pick your favorite game? Dropdown or text error
      It seems to not showcase what we’ve done or learned (most of these could be easily called out now from the raw data
      ***
      COMPLEX: If we were to ask more complex questions to add interest:
        -	What type of player are you? Dropdown of player types
        -	Show random board game images and have them pick?
        -	Create personas of players and have them pick from a short description?
      Could we then choose our recommendations from a more sophisticated cluster?? Would it be more interesting to the user?
      ***
      COMBO: One suggestion was to ask something and provide the two different results, one from a straight query and one from a cluster query based on our machine learning results (provided they are different somehow (?)
      
  - Some sort of machine-learning step -- need to investigate data for interesting patterns   
  - Putting the data into a database and building the queries (OR advanced tableau?)
  - Building a dashboard that showcases:
      -	Info about our data that we found interesting (maybe some history even)
      -	Random shopping/browsing visual?  
      -	Info about our question/game & Instructions for the user
      -	Results


### (Alt Note: Personas?)
There are four established game personas per Bartle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types) Perhaps there is some way to utilize these classifications, or to align our game styles with these?

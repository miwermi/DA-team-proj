REDUCING DATA FOR VISUALIZATION
Options considered for reducing the number of games:
•	If we limited games to those that received over 1000 user ratings, we end up with 1/8th of our original 20000 (about 2500)
•	If we Limited games to those that received over 100 user ratings, we end up losing a little less than half of our 20000

In the end, we did not drop ANY games from the original 20000 for our data visualization.
The clustered bins from Abe's machine learning seem to hold some promise!

Final categories and mechanisms are below. Files uploaded to tableau are in the resources-3 folder.
